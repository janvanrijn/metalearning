## Meta-Knowledge Transfer/Communication in Different Systems
This workshop will be co-hosted with [ECML/PKDD 2022 in Grenoble, France](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It will be a half-day workshop, along with a half-day tutorial on Metalearning. 

### Invited Speakers
* [Timothy Hospedales](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, University of Edinburgh, Scotland
  * Title: Meta-learning for Knowledge Transfer
* [Pascal Hitzler](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Kansas State University, USA
  * Title: Some advances regarding ontologies and neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence

### Call For Papers
Metaknowledge normally captures different aspects of existing (or potential) solutions, including, for instance which preprocessing methods should be used for the given data; which ML algorithms are relevant; which hyperparameters should be considered and how should these be set; how should all these elements be combined into useful pipelines or procedures. The aim of this workshop is to address the issues related to how (meta-)knowledge can be generated and transferred among different ML and AutoML systems, so that their joint capability to solve problems would be enhanced.

Main research areas:

* Controlling the learning processes
* Definitions of configuration spaces
* Few-shot learning
* Elaboration of feature hierarchies
* Exploiting hierarchy of features in learning
* Meta-learning
* Conditional meta-learning
* Meta-knowledge transfer
* Transfer learning
* Transfer of prior models
* Transfer of meta-knowledge between systems
* Symbolic vs subsymbolic meta-knowledge
* Neuro-symbolic learning and meta-learning
* Explainable and interpretable meta-learning

### Submission Format

This workshop hosts two tracks:

* Original paper track: Authors can submit novel papers, that have not been accepted elsewhere. Please format your submission according to the LaTeX [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} format, maximal 12 pages.
* Poster of already published work: Authors can apply for a poster spot for a paper that has recently (less than 2 years) been published elsewhere. During submission, you send a link to the already published version of the work, and the peer-review will determine whether it is a good match based on the topic. 

Submissions can be made through [Microsoft CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/METALEARNING2022/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

### Format of the Workshop

The workshop will last a half a day, as it is forms part of a combined tutorial-workshop. It will include: 

* Invited talks
* Short oral presentations
* Poster session 
* Panel discussions on "Main challenges of communication of (meta)-knowledge among different systems"

### Proceedings

The organizers are planning to prepare formal proceedings. The authors of accepted papers can decide whether they wish to have their full paper included or not. In the latter case, publication of short abstract would be possible.

### Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: June 27th, 2022 (extended)
* Paper acceptance notification: July 20th, 2022 (extended)
* Early registration deadline: July 22th, 2022
* Program and papers will be available online by: September 5th, 2022
* Workshop date: September 23rd, 2022 (afternoon)
