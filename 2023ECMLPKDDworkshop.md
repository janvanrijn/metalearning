### Call For Papers
This workshop explores different types of meta-knowledge, such as performance summary statistics or pre-trained model weights. 
One way of acquiring meta-knowledge is by observing learning processes and representing it in such a way that it can be used later to improve future learning processes. 
AutoML systems typically explore meta-knowledge acquired from a single task, e.g., by modelling the relationship between hyperparameters and model performance. 
Metalearning systems, on the other hand, normally explore metaknowledge acquired on a collection of machine learning tasks. 
This can be used not only for selection of the best workflow(s) for the current task, but also for adaptation and fine-tuning of a prior model to the new task. 
Many current AutoML and metalearning systems exploit both types of meta-knowledge. 
Neuro-symbolic systems explore the interplay between neural network-based learning and symbol-based learning to get the best of those two types of learning. 
While doing so, it tries to use the existing knowledge as a concrete symbolic representation or as a transformed version of the symbolic representation suited for the learning algorithm. 
The goal of this workshop is to explore ways in which ideas can be cross-pollinated between the AutoML/Metalearning and neuro-symbolic learning research communities. 
This could lead to, e.g., systems with interpretable meta-knowledge, and tighter integration between machine learning workflows and automated reasoning systems. 

Main research areas:

* Controlling the learning processes
* Definitions of configuration spaces
* Few-shot learning
* Elaboration of feature hierarchies
* Exploiting hierarchy of features in learning
* Meta-learning
* Conditional meta-learning
* Meta-knowledge transfer
* Transfer learning
* Transfer of prior models
* Transfer of meta-knowledge between systems
* Symbolic vs subsymbolic meta-knowledge
* Neuro-symbolic learning 
* Explainable and interpretable meta-learning
* Explainable artificial intelligence

### Submission

This workshop hosts the following tracks:

* Original paper track: Authors can submit novel papers, that have not been accepted elsewhere. Please format your submission according to the LaTeX [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} format, maximal 12 pages. (closed)
* Poster of already published work: Authors can apply for a poster spot for a paper that has recently (less than 2 years) been published elsewhere. During submission, you send a link to the already published version of the work, and the peer-review will determine whether it is a good match based on the topic. (closed)
* Late breaking papers: Authors can submit a 2-page abstract of already published work, or work to be published, that will undergo a light review process tailored towards applicability towards the workshop. The work will end up in the proceedings. (closed)

Submissions go through [the Conference Management Tool](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDDworkshop2023/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, please ensure to select the right track: `Neuro-symbolic Metalearning and AutoML`.
