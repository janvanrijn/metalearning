## Meta-Knowledge Transfer/Communication in Different Systems
This workshop will be co-hosted with [ECML/PKDD 2022 in Grenoble, France](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/). It will be a half-day workshop, along with a half-day tutorial on Metalearning. 

### Invited Speakers
* [Timothy Hospedalis](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/)
* [Pascal Hitzler](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/)

### Call For Papers
Metaknowledge normally captures different aspects of existing (or potential) solutions, including, for instance which preprocessing methods should be used for the given data; which ML algorithms are relevant; which hyperparameters should be considered and how should these be set; how should all these elements be combined into useful pipelines or procedures. The aim of this workshop is to address the issues related to how (meta-)knowledge can be generated and transferred among different ML and AutoML systems, so that their joint capability to solve problems would be enhanced.

Main research areas:
* Controlling the learning processes
* Definitions of configuration spaces
* Few-shot learning
* Elaboration of feature hierarchies
* Exploiting hierarchy of features in learning
* Meta-learning
* Conditional meta-learning
* Meta-knowledge transfer
* Transfer learning
* Transfer of prior models
* Transfer of meta-knowledge between systems
* Symbolic vs subsymbolic meta-knowledge
* Neuro-symbolic learning and meta-learning
* Explainable and interpretable meta-learning

### Important Dates
