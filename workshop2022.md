## Meta-Knowledge Transfer/Communication in Different Systems
This workshop will be co-hosted with [ECML/PKDD 2022 in Grenoble, France](https://2022.ecmlpkdd.org/). It will be a half-day workshop, along with a half-day tutorial on Metalearning. 

### Invited Speakers
* [Timothy Hospedalis](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/)
* [Pascal Hitzler](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~hitzler/)

### Call For Papers
Metaknowledge normally captures different aspects of existing (or potential) solutions, including, for instance which preprocessing methods should be used for the given data; which ML algorithms are relevant; which hyperparameters should be considered and how should these be set; how should all these elements be combined into useful pipelines or procedures. The aim of this workshop is to address the issues related to how (meta-)knowledge can be generated and transferred among different ML and AutoML systems, so that their joint capability to solve problems would be enhanced.

Main research areas:
* Controlling the learning processes
* Definitions of configuration spaces
* Few-shot learning
* Elaboration of feature hierarchies
* Exploiting hierarchy of features in learning
* Meta-learning
* Conditional meta-learning
* Meta-knowledge transfer
* Transfer learning
* Transfer of prior models
* Transfer of meta-knowledge between systems
* Symbolic vs subsymbolic meta-knowledge
* Neuro-symbolic learning and meta-learning
* Explainable and interpretable meta-learning

### Submission Format

This workshop hosts two tracks:
* Original paper track: Authors can submit novel papers, that have not been accepted elsewhere. Please format your submission according to the LaTeX [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs) format, maximal 12 pages. Note that this does not exclude you from sending this work later to other conferences or journals. 
* Poster of already published work: Authors can apply for a poster spot for a paper that has recently (less than 2 years) been published elsewhere. During submission, you send a link to the already published version of the work, and the peer-review will determine whether it is a good match based on the topic. 

### Proceedings

The papers from the original paper track will be allowed the option to opt-in for publication in formal proceedings (exact venue TBD). 

### Important Dates

* Paper submission deadline: June 20th, 2022
* Paper acceptance notification: July 13th, 2022
* Early registration deadline: July 22th, 2022
* Program and papers will be available online by: September 5th, 2022
* Workshop date: September 23rd, 2022 (afternoon)
