## Metalearning

Metalearning is a scientific field that aims to leverage knowledge of the machine learning process in data science applications.

On this website, we aim to keep track of various scientific resources regarding metalearning, such as the Open Access book `Metalearning: Applications to Automated Machine Learning and Data Mining` as well as the ECML/PKDD 2022 workshop on `Meta-Knowledge Transfer/Communication in Different Systems`.
